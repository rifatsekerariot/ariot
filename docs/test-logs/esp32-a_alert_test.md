## 📊 Test Results Analysis

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Alert Trigger Time** | 18ms | <50ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Gateway Response** | 6ms | <20ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Total Alert Latency** | 24ms | <50ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Data Transmission Latency** | 22-28ms | <50ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Sync Accuracy** | ±2ms | ±5ms | ✅ PASS |

### Message Sequence Analysis
1. **Normal Operation**: Temperature data sent every 1000ms in assigned slot
2. **Threshold Detection**: Local temperature check after each increment
3. **Alert Transmission**: Immediate out-of-band alert (bypassed slot timing)
4. **Gateway Processing**: Alert received and acknowledged within 6ms
5. **Continued Operation**: Normal data transmission resumed

### Network Performance
- **Packet Loss**: 0% during test period
- **WiFi Signal**: Stable at -45dBm
- **Sync Stability**: ±2ms deviation (within tolerance)
- **Slot Timing**: Consistent 10ms slot duration

## 🔹 Detailed Timeline

| Time | Event | Latency | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| 14:32:32.271 | Data transmission (29.8°C) | 26ms | Last normal reading |
| 14:32:32.275 | Threshold check | - | Local ESP32 processing |
| 14:32:32.289 | Alert transmission | 18ms | Emergency message sent |
| 14:32:32.295 | Gateway ACK | 6ms | Alert acknowledged |
| 14:32:33.278 | Next data cycle | 24ms | Normal operation resumed |
